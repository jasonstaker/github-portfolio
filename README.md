# My Calender Project

## Why?
I may have the **worst memory** on the planet. I cannot remember things if my life depended on it, and because of that, I have had to develop a very **complex** way of keeping myself on top of school work and day-to-day tasks. How I remember things is usually unique to me, and I find different ways to use different Chrome extensions or tools I already have *unconventionally*. Ever since I started coding, I've always wanted to make an application that I can tailor to my specific needs as a student who also needs to organize their social and professional life. So that is who this project is for; it's an **advanced calendar** for college students.

## Features
My application will do the following:
- It will be able to categorize events based on user-made categories
- The user-made categories will be fully customizable to whatever the user needs
- In this menu, students will be given a variety of options to choose from, such as whether it is a class, some common links for the class, or when homework is typically due.
- You will be able to filter based on categories, and you will be able to make subcategories as well. For example, under the school category, you can make homework assignments and class schedules to view when you have class and when everything is due for the class on one calendar.
- You can also make recurring events.
