# 🚀 Jason Staker's GitHub Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Jason, a second-year Computer Science student at UBC passionate about rendering, physics simulation, and systems programming. Below are some of my featured projects, feel free to explore the code, demos, and write-ups.

## 🔭 Featured Projects

### 1. Schwarzschild Ray Tracer
**Repo:** [schwarzschild-ray-tracer](https://github.com/jasonstaker/schwarzschild-blackhole-renderer.git)

A high-performance C++ simulation tracing light around a Schwarzschild black hole. Utilizes numerical integration of null geodesics in curved spacetime, multithreaded rendering with OpenMP, and a GoogleTest suite for validation.

### 2. 2D Physics Engine & Renderer
**Repo:** [2d-physics-demo](https://github.com/jasonstaker/2d-physics-demo.git)

A real-time 2D physics demo built in C++17 and SFML. Supports rigid-body dynamics, quadtree-based collision culling for 1K+ entities at 60 FPS, and interactive controls (pause, slow motion, overlays).
